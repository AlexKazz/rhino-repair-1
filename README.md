Project prototype built during a 24-hour <a href='https://www.aectech.us/'>AEC Tech</a> hackathon.
<br>
<br>
Its purpose is to demonstrate a potential solution to improve efficiency in the structural inspection process.
<br>
<br>
Normally, when a structure such as a bridge requires inspection, the junior inspector is sent to the bridge to determine if any repairs are required. If there is an issue, such as a crack somewhere on the bridge, the inspector must take a photo and write an extensive report describing the crack and its location. This report is then sent to a senior inspector who must spend time reading the report and determine a plan of action.
<br>
<br>
On a larger scale, this leaves a senior inspector with many reports that they must read through and analyze, which can sometimes take months. This prototype aims to demonstrate how these tedious reports can be partially replaced in a 2-part process - having a central location for Rhino3D models to be stored and viewed by not only an engineer who has access to a computer with Rhino3D installed, but by anyone on the engineering team and, most importantly, being able to place "nodes" on the 3D model that, when clicked, display the photo of the structural damage.
<br>
<br>
Rather than having to read a report and depend on the precision of the junior inspector's writing to understand the precise location of the structural damage, the senior inspector (and anyone else on the team) can see the 3D model with the node at the exact location of the damage, and click on the node to view the photo of it. With hundreds of reports, this would greatly reduce the time it would take to locate and assess the damage.

Due to the strict time constraints of the hackathon, there was not enough time to implement the technology necessary to create a database to store the uploaded images, implement a server to handle the Rhino3D file conversions to a file type such as U3D (3D pdf), and give the user the ability to add a "node" to the model, but the purpose of this prototype was to demonstrate one possible way to optimize the efficiency of the structural inspection process.
